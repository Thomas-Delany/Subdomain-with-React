English Reservoir is composed of two primary infrastructures,

1. The main country level domains. Depending on your country, it could be .es, .com, .fr for Spain, world and France respectively. These websites serve as the entry point to English Reservoir for the respective language areas, as well as to provide an English Reservoir of free resources, content and more. The repository for our template site and more info on this can be found here: https://github.com/Thomas-Delany/English_Reservoir

2. The courses (in this repository). All our course infrastructure is to be built on a separate subdomain where students and affiliates can access the learning platform.

What’s this project about?

Subdomain-with-React serves primarily as a prototype for the frontend of the courses subdomain for English Reservoir. I'll use it as a testing ground to enact changes before pushing changes to the private repo where more sensitive data is located, and for which the live site will be using.

Similar to the template site (GitHub repository attached above), which I built to serve as a common infrastructure for all English Reservoir domains, this project’s aim is to build a template site for all english reservoir subdomains for our courses.

For example, currently, we have:

“englishreservoir.es” as well as “englishreservoir.com/es”, which serve as the main sites for Spanish speakers, and the current course infrastructure for said domains are on:

“cursos.englishreservoir.com”.

In a nutshell, this project's main objective is to build a completely new course infrastructure with React and Tailwind, and which should serve as the main template site for all future course subdomains. Further, it is also to replace our current third party provider.

So, in the future, sites such as “englishreservoir.de” or “englishreservoir.fr” for German and French speakers, would have their course infrastructure on “kurse.englishreservoir.de” and “cours.englishreservoir.fr” respectively.

This project will surely be a large endeavour and new languages and frameworks will need to be included throughout the build.

What is to be built?

- A new template site for all course subdomains, which will serve English learners from all over the globe.
- Frontend for our current subscription based package.
- An interactive English learning application.
- An affiliate infrastructure.
- And much more.

Stay tuned for more updates.
